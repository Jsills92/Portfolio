      <article>
        <p>At its heart, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> is a language made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
        <p>Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
        <p>It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic. However, this isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

        <p>After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>

        <p>We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content! This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.</p>
        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
        <p>Before starting this module, you should have a reasonable understanding of the basics of HTML, as previously covered in Introduction to HTML. If you have not worked through this module (or something similar), work through it first, then come back!</p>

      <header>HTML tables</header>
      <article>
        <p>A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.</p>
         <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
        <p>Before starting this module, you should already have covered the basics of HTML — see Introduction to HTML.</p>

        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
         <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
        <li>Basic familiarity with using computers and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)</li>
        <li>A basic work environment set up, as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.</li>
        <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>

        <p>This module carries on where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS first steps</a> left off — now that you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text">text styling</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout">CSS layout</a>.</p>

      <article>
        <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
        <p>Before starting this module, you should already have basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module, and be comfortable with CSS fundamentals, as discussed in Introduction to CSS.</p>

        <p>At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>

  <li>Buy cat food</li>
